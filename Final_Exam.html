HINT: Make sure to store anything you create or access as 'variables' so you can use them later.

9. Follow all directions below:
- Create an HTML file with boilerplate code. Name it: `Final_Exam_ISI_CS_2022` with the correct file extension. (2 points - without this step you can't do the rest)
- Create a JavaScript file. Name it: `Final_Exam_ISI_CS_2022` with the correct file extension. (1 point - without this step you can't do the rest)
- Link (i.e. connect) your newly created HTML and JavaScript files together. (HINT: USE the `Script` element tag!) (1 point - without this step you can't do the rest)
- In your HTML file, add a `h1` HTML element tag with an `id` attribute of `my-final`. (2 points)
- In your JavaScript file "only", do all of the following using JS DOM methods:
  a) Create a new `div` element. (1 point)
  b) Give that newly created `div` element an `id` attribute of `new-div`. (1 point)
  c) Add filler code/dummy code (i.e. Lorem ipsum...) plain text to the newly created `div` element. (1 point)
  d) Attach the newly created `div` element to the `body` of your HTML element.(1 point)

Part IV: GitHub Repository (7 points):

HINT: Be to sure to change directory (i.e. `CD`) in your terminal (command prompt) whenever you need to!

10. Follow all directions below:
  - Create a GitHub repository using your own account. Name it `Final_Exam_ISI_CS_2022`. Add a ReadMe file. Make it `public`. (1 point)
  - Clone it locally to your desktop.
  - Put your linked HTML and JavaScript final exam files in it. Also, put your final exam markdown file in it (meaing this file itself). (3 points)
  - CD into your local repo. (without this step you can't do the rest)
  - Do 3 git commands/operations to update your 'remote' repo with your 'local' one. (3 points)
  - Double check to see if your 'remote' repo is updated with all the necessary files. Your repo on GitHub should have the following 4 files:
  a) Readme file
  b) HTML file: Final_Exam_ISI_CS_2022
  c) JS file: Final_Exam_ISI_CS_2022
  d) Final_Exam_CS-2022.md file (this file itself)

NOTE BENE: If you haven't provided me your GitHub account URL address then make sure you do! (e.g. <https://github.com/your-github-account-goes-here>)
